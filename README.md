# Interactive-Python-Programing-

Mini-Games 

Showcases the basics of building simple interactive applications. The mini games were developed using a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications involved windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse. the basic elements of programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) were used to create simple interactive applications such as a digital stopwatch. It culminated in building a version of the classic arcade game "Pong". More elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) were also used to create games such as Blackjack.

The mini games can be viewed and run online using [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/).
